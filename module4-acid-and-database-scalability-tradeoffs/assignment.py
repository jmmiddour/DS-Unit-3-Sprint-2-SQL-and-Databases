Practice! 
Go back to both your deployed PostgreSQL (Titanic data) and 
MongoDB (RPG data) instances - use MongoDB queries to answer 
the same questions as you did from the first module (when the 
RPG data was in SQLite). With PostgreSQL, answer the following:

How many passengers survived, and how many died?
How many passengers were in each class?
How many passengers survived/died within each class?
What was the average age of survivors vs nonsurvivors?
What was the average age of each passenger class?
What was the average fare by passenger class? By survival?
How many siblings/spouses aboard on average, by passenger class? 
    By survival?
How many parents/children aboard on average, by passenger class? 
    By survival?
Do any passengers have the same name?
(Bonus! Hard, may require pulling and processing with Python) 
How many married couples were aboard the Titanic? 
    Assume that two people (one Mr. and one Mrs.) with the same last 
    name and with at least 1 sibling/spouse aboard are a married couple.
