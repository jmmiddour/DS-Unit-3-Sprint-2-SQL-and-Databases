        "**Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is SQL?\n",
        "\t- Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
        "\t- Is the standard language for interating with (accessing and manipulate) databases using queries.\n",
        "\t- Became a standard of the American National Standards Institue (ANSI) in 1986 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.\n",
        "\t- There are different versions of SQL such as;\n",
        "\t\t- MySQL \n",
        "\t\t\t- The most popular in Stack Overflow. \n",
        "\t\t\t- Similar in syntex to SQLite and PostgreSQL.\n",
        "\t\t- SQLite \n",
        "\t\t\t- Similar in syntex to MySQL and PostgreSQL.\n",
        "\t\t- PostgreSQL \n",
        "\t\t\t- Best starter version of SQL.\n",
        "\t\t\t- Similar in syntex to MySQL and SQLite.\n",
        "\t\t\t- The syntex most closely conforms to Standard SQL\n",
        "\t\t- SQL Server\n",
        "\t\t\t- An important database management system in many industries.\n",
        "\t\t- T-SQL \n",
        "\t\t\t- The name of Microsoft's dialect of SQL. Has the greatest contrast in SQL syntex and a wide variety of functions not available in other platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a RDBMS?\n",
        "\t- Rational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)\n",
        "\t- A Rational DataBase is a type of database that uses structure that allows you to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. \n",
        "\t- Most often is a relational database that is organized into tables\n",
        "\t- Management System is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a rational database.\n",
        "\t- Most RDBMS use SQL language to access the database.\n",
        "3. What is an ETL pipeline?\n",
        "\t- Extract Transform Load (ELT)\n",
        "\t- A set of processes extracting data from an imput source, then transforming the data and then finally loading the data into an output destination, such as a database, to use for reporting, analysis, and data synchronization.\n",
        "4. What is a schema?\n",
        "\t- A map of the database. \n",
        "\t- Explains attributes or columns in each table within the database.\n",
        "\t- Provides the primary and foriegn keys for each table to show their ralationship to each other.\n",
        "\t- Sets the requirements of the type of data that can be stored in each column.\n",
        "5. What does each letter in ACID stand for? Give an explanation for each and why they matter?\n",
        "\t- **A** = Atomicity\n",
        "\t\t- Guarantees that each transaction goes through completely or the transaction fails as a whole.\n",
        "\t\t- Each \"transaction\" is counted as a single unit of a whole.\n",
        "\t- **C** = Consistancy\n",
        "\t\t- If all values are not formatted correctly it will not add the record at all.\n",
        "\t\t- All attribrutes must be met.\n",
        "\t\t- Upon completion of a transaction the database is structurally sound.\n",
        "\t- **I** = Isolation\n",
        "\t\t- Ensures that concurrent execution leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained in they were executed seperately.\n",
        "\t\t- Access to the data is moderated by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.\n",
        "\t- **D** = Durability (Fault Tolerance)\n",
        "\t\t- Guarantees that once a record has been commited, it will remain commited even in the case of a system failure.\n",
        "\t- Best for using when dealing with data that has to be consistant at all times. No room for error, such as banking institutes.\n",
        "6. Explain each of the table relationships and give an example for each\n",
        "\t- One-to-One = There will only be one record in the first table (primary) that relates to only one record in the second table (foreign).\n",
        "\t- One-to-Many = There will only be one record in the  first table (primary) that relates to zero, one, or multiple records in the second table (foreign).\n",
        "\t- Many-to-Many = There can be zero, one, or multiple records in the first table (primary) that relates to zero, one, or multiple records in the second table (foreign)."
